        <p> I have been awarded the Sr. Thea Bowman Undergraduate Student Fellowships in Ethics. My fellowship is designed to educate the Villanova community on the problems of mass incarceration. I plan to do this through a few on campus events including a Movie watch of the film The 13th with pizza from Down North Philly, a pizza shop who only hires former inmates. Then I plan to connect Villanova students to Mary Mother of Captives and organize a pen pal program. I also want to conduct a toiletry drive for Mothers Returning Home, a buisness who works with women who were recently released from prison and helps them get back on their feet.  </p>
